# AI-Final-Research-Project

This final project looks at machine learning pipeline for a Regression task on Abalone dataset. The pipeline steps are data ingestion, preprocessing, training the models, hyperparameter tuning, prediction and saving the model for later use. Top three models were used to compare metric for which model is best. The results suggest that Bayesian Ridge does the best out of all with 0.5516% accuracy on new dataset. This model was tested and tuned to give the best result and was saved to retest on new unseen data.
